#and end, then run a for loop each time for different values of x. NB- Row is position, coloumn is time.

#I think it could be good to plot the paths to ensure i have the right thing

#This code makes a simple 2D co-ordinate system for our particles to live in. 
#Next, i need to code a) how the particle proceeds through the grid, however this also involves the integral 
#so i will park this for now.
