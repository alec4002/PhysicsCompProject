#The integral must be done over each step of the path, for each path. I could use vegas to evaluate the integral at each of the steps for me in 
#one go instead of myself looping it. I get a weight for each path from the integral, and this distribution should give me the ground state.
#G comes from the action, which comes from the hamiltonian of the system, which we know
